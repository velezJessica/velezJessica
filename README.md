- 👋 Hi, I’m @velezJessica
- 👀 I’m interested in artificial intelligence,cybersecurity,cooking,mathematics and inclusivity/advocacy!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning computer science with a minor in math and cybersecurity at the university of Nevada, Reno
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an app that could more accurately create closed captioning for videos/ apps as an extension so we're more inclusive to the deaf community
-  I am also working on a project that would cross reference foods in your fridge to latin american cuisine and give you a recipe with cooking time and links to videos of food content creators! 
- 📫 How to reach me: Jessicavelez@nevada.unr.edu
